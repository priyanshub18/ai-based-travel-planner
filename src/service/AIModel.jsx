Always book in advance for best rates.\n*   **Transportation:** The itinerary assumes the use of ride-sharing (Uber/Lyft) for travel when it\'s not walkable. Consider a day rental car for Day 3 to see Red Rock Canyon more comfortably.\n*   **Food:** I haven\'t listed specific restaurants, but there are plenty of affordable options in Las Vegas, including buffets, fast food, and casual eateries.\n*   **Image URLs:** The image URLs are placeholders (`https://example.com/...`). Replace these with actual URLs of the relevant images.\n*  **Geo Coordinates**: Use these to get the exact directions of each places\n\nThis JSON provides a solid foundation for planning a budget-friendly romantic trip to Las Vegas! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n',
